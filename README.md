# Parental Game Database

[![CI](https://github.com/james-stocks/pgd/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/james-stocks/pgd/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A database of useful information for parent gamers. Can you pause cutscenes? Is quick resume broken? Let's find out!  
This is NOT a database of suitability of child-friendly content, it's for you the parent to know if you can get 5-10 minutes of gameplay in peace. Though the database does remark on games that are more or less risky to play when a child might crash into the room at any moment :)

## Where does this run?
